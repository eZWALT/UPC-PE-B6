# Probability and Statistics Final Project (PE)

## Description

This repository contains the final project for Probablity and Statistics (PE) subject 2021-22 Q1, which consisted on comparing the implementations of the heapsort algorithm in two different languages and infering statistical conclusions of the experiment.

## Contents 

- **generate_numbers.c**: This simple file generates a set of random numbers
- **heapsort.c**
- **heapsort.py**
- **main_script.R**: This script carries out the computations, plotting and hypotheses testing.

## Usage 

Unfortunately there is no automation script to carry out this task (Even though it would be simple to implement), so one must generate the data using **generate_numbers.c** and then manually ingesting the input to both **heapsort.\*** programs and through an excel file executing the **main_sript.R**. 

## Additional resources

The excel data used on this experiment and the slides are private. In order to access them one needs a **@upc.edu** domain email:
